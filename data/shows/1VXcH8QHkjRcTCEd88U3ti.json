Fifth-generation rice farmer Jim Whitaker and his daughter, farmer and conservationist Jessica Whitaker Allen, are working to slash rice&#39;s environmental impacts with innovative, sustainable farming practices. They share how they&#39;re keeping their family farm in Arkansas profitable while also spreading green farming practices to their neighbors — and, eventually, the rest of the world. &#34;If you take care of the planet, it will take care of you,&#34; says Whitaker Allen.",

      "html_description": "The traditional approach to work needs a redesign, says economist Juliet Schor. She&#39;s leading four-day work week trials in countries like the US and Ireland, and the results so far have been overwhelmingly positive: from increased employer and customer satisfaction to revenue growth and lower turnover. Making the case for a four-day, 32-hour work week (with five days of pay), Schor explains how this model for the future of work could address major challenges like burnout and the climate crisis -- and shares how companies and governments could work together to make it a reality.",
