      "description": "There are only two mammals who have evolved to survive after their child bearing years: toothed whales and humans. This stage of life is called menopause, and it makes humans an evolutionary wonder! But our perception of it has been shaped by centuries of stigma and shame—up until recently it was even considered a \"disease\" by the medical establishment that needed to be cured. Menopause isn't a disease, but that doesn't mean it's a party either. There can be troublesome symptoms for many people. So you might be thinking, \"I'm not in menopause now\" or \"I'm not going to go through menopause, ever. Why should I care?\" Dr. Jen tells us why while taking us through the complex history of how we got here, giving hot tips on managing hot flashes, and sharing why menopause shouldn't be viewed as the end of the race, but a victory lap.  You can read the text transcript for this episode at go.ted.com/BodyStuffTranscript3.

      "html_description": "<p>The Bean needs to move over — there&#39;s a new art movement in Chicago, and it&#39;s led by artists who are completely reimagining how residents think about the spaces around them. Join Far Flung host Saleem Reshamwala on a bold, creative and winding road trip to witness the power of place-based art. From abandoned homes that turn into artwork when they are painted in colors rooted in Black culture, to multimedia projects that examine segregation and connect people who live on opposite sides of the city, stimulate your soul with ideas that flow from the heartland. </p><br/><p>Far Flung is another podcast from the TED Audio Collective. For more, find Far Flung wherever you get your podcasts.</p>",
